# Twitch Integration Fixes!
This [mod](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jFbpnmgsmudkeuw79Z3p_vqa7vGZWdvW/view?usp=sharing) changes some of the twitch integration xml files.
#### Pimp Points
+ Non Sub PP Cap increased to: 5000
+ Sub PP Cap increased to: 25000
#### Debuffs
+ Degrade: disabled
+ Spoil: disabled
+ NoMelee: disabled
+ NoVehicle: disabled
+ NoRobo: disabled
+ NoRanged: disabled

### That's it
I turned them off this way simply because they really make it impossible to play.
