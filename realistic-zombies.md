# Realistic Zombies!
This [modlet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zOXl5YNiqOEupDau0aTzywANGba1GUna/view?usp=sharing) just changes zombies to be a little more realistic.
### Movement
+ Zombies now swim much slower. (since I can't turn it off)
+ Zombies can no longer climb ladders.
+ Zombies now also attack animals.
### Misc
+ Headshots that kill explode/sever the head more often. (they are decaying)
+ Yellow loot bags now spawn more often. (25% chance per kill)
