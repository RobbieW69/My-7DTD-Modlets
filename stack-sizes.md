# Editable Stack Sizes!
This [modlet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mkGsMvURZ5YWi78q9ACwDX3aAH5QFVfK/view?usp=sharing) is a normal modlet that changes stack sizes to 50k by default.   
However I've included a ReadMe along with it that teaches you how to edit it to whatever you'd like!    
Very simple and easy to follow!
